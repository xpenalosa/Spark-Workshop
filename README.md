# Spark Workshop

This project contains the Jupyter notebooks completed during an Apache Spark workshop that took place in Barcelona during the first week of September 2019.

The notebooks have been completed with the guidance of Petar Zečević, author of the book **Spark in Action**. He explained the basics of Apache Spark and different add-ons available to the engine (GraphX, GraphFrames, SparkML). Several slides, as well as a diploma, were distributed to the assistants for completing the workshop. However, we have not been given permission to upload these.
